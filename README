Nnview is an extension of Ncview by David W. Pierce, which includes
file access ability to TOUZA/Nio formats, as well as some additional
features lacked in the original Ncview.

Everything related to copying, etc, follows the original policy of
Ncview except where explicitly indicated.

All the modification and one new file src/file_nio.c are
Copyright (c) 2022-2023 Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology.

Nnview is maintained by SAITO Fuyuki.

You need TOUZA library (1.10 or later) to build Nnview.
TOUZA is available on https://github.com/saitofuyuki/touza.

Several files in the original package are renamed or archived under
misc/ directory.  See README.ncview ChangeLog.ncview for the original
information.

How to install nnview
---------------------

See file "INSTALL" for the original description.  This file describes
only Nnview related staffs.

You MUST install TOUZA library version 1.10 or later before trying
to install nnview.  Note that, TOUZA library also supports NetCDF and
optionally requires NetCDF installation beforehand.  If you use TOUZA
library for other purposes than Nnview, you should install NetCDF
before TOUZA.  For nnview builds only, TOUZA installation may not
require NetCDF.

TOUZA library is searched using pkg-config utility.  When search
fails, please set appropriate values for some or all of the following
variables at configure nnview.

  PKG_CONFIG           path to pkg-config utility
  PKG_CONFIG_PATH      directories to add to pkg-config's search path
  PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR    path overriding pkg-config's built-in search path

In the worst case it still fails, please set the compiler and linker
flags directly:

  TOUZA_CFLAGS    C compiler flags for TOUZA, overriding pkg-config
  TOUZA_LIBS      linker flags for TOUZA, overriding pkg-config
  TOUZA_FCLIBS    value of fclibs for touza, overriding pkg-config
